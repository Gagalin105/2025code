-Change all colors from "text-primery" to <style="color: darkcyan;">
    -changing one by one(it's really tiring and boring)
    -including the text, the background of the switch and the icon
    -Founding that I can build a "style.css" to set up the primery color the day after I started working at color changing.
    -Founding that I can't just set the colors up in my own .css file, so I turn to changing the name of class.
-Change the infromation in the pre-web
